  <h3>A Lightning Talk for DH2020
    <br>By Julia Uhr</h3>
  <br>
  The Special Collections of CU Fairytale Library (SCCUFL) is a virtual reality library built using A-Frame and featuring illustrated and historical fairy tales from the University of Colorado Boulder Libraries' Department of Special Collections, Archives and Preservation.
  The aim of this project is to give students and the general public access to special collections books in an immersive and interactive virtual environment to increase engagement with the material.
  <br><br>
  SCCUFL can be viewed at <a href="https://juliauhr.github.io/sccufl">juliauhr.github.io/sccufl</a>.
  <br>
  The code is open-source and can be found at <a href="https://github.com/juliauhr/sccufl">github.com/juliauhr/sccufl</a>.
